    "* IMDb ratings database for average user ratings on films. \n",

    "Based on our initial proposal, we deemed originally that any film with a 7 or above IMDb rating and an ROI percentage of 5000% were worthy of replicating. Unfortunately this made too small a sample size; we were able to discern through our original query that the true average score of films in our IMDb database is a 6.14 and that 5000% ROI was too narrow of a pathway for our first film's successful voyage.
